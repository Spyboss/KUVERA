## Strategy Overview

### Mean-Reversion Algorithm

Our proprietary mean-reversion strategy operates on the principle that BTC/USDT prices tend to revert to their moving average over time.

#### Signal Generation
1. **Entry Condition**: Price falls below SMA by threshold percentage
2. **Exit Condition**: Price rises above SMA by threshold percentage
3. **Stop Loss**: Triggered at 2% below entry price
4. **Position Size**: Calculated based on risk per trade and stop-loss distance

#### Risk Framework
- **Maximum Position Size**: Limited to 1% of total capital
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Position size adjusts based on volatility
- **Correlation Limits**: Prevents overexposure to correlated movements
- **Time-based Exits**: Positions closed after maximum holding period
